The Bridges of Königsberg is a famous problem in the
history of mathematics and graph theory, first solved by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1736.
The problem is set in the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), which is situated on both sides of 
the Pregel River and includes two large islands connected by seven bridges.

The problem can be described as follows:

The city of Königsberg is divided into four landmasses: two large islands and the mainland on either side of the Pregel River.

Seven bridges connect these landmasses, with two on one island, four on the mainland, and one on the other island.

The challenge is to find a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Leonhard Euler approached this problem by abstracting it into a graph theory context, representing 
the landmasses as nodes (vertices) and the bridges as edges. Euler's solution involved analyzing the degree
(number of edges incident to a vertex) of each landmass. He discovered that for a walk to exist as described,
each landmass needed to have an even degree, except for possibly two landmasses, which could have an odd degree.

In the case of Königsberg, all four landmasses had an odd degree, making it impossible to find such a walk. 
Euler's conclusion laid the foundation for the development of graph theory.

The Bridges of Königsberg problem is often cited as the starting point for the field of graph theory, which has
since become a fundamental area of study in mathematics and computer science. Euler's insights into this problem 
led to the creation of graph theory concepts such as Eulerian paths and circuits, which are essential in understanding the properties of graphs and networks.
