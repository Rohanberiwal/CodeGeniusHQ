Kruskal's algorithm, on the other hand, builds the minimum spanning 
tree by considering all edges in the graph, sorted by weight. It adds the
edges to the minimum spanning tree in ascending order of weight, avoiding the creation of cycles in the process.

Here's a high-level overview of Kruskal's algorithm:

Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
Initialize an empty minimum spanning tree.
Iterate through the sorted edges and add each edge to the minimum spanning tree if it doesn't create a cycle.
Repeat step 3 until the minimum spanning tree has 

nâˆ’1 edges (where 

n is the number of vertices).
