Prim's Algorithm:
Prim's algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows
the minimum spanning tree one vertex at a time. At each step, it selects '
the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the growing minimum spanning tree 
to a vertex outside the tree. This process continues until all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree.

Here's a high-level overview of Prim's algorithm:

Procedure for the prims algorithm 
Start with an arbitrary vertex.
Select the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the current minimum spanning tree to a vertex outside the tree.
Add the selected edge and the connected vertex to the minimum spanning tree.
Repeat steps 2-3 until all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree.
Time Complexity:

Prim's: 
O((V+E)logV) with an adjacency list using a priority queue.
Prim's: 
Space Complexity  :
O(V) for the priority queue or 
O(1) with a simple array.
