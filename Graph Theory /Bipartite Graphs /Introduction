A bipartite graph is a type of graph in which the set of vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. In other words, a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be colored with two colors in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Formally, a graph 
G=(V,E) is bipartite if there exists a partition of its vertex set 
V into two disjoint sets 
V−U such that every edge in 
E has one end in 
U and the other end in 
V−U.

Mathematically, a graph 
G is bipartite if and only if it is possible to assign one of two different colors to each vertex 
in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This can be expressed as a coloring function 
f:V→{0,1}, where 

Bipartite graphs have several interesting properties and are widely used in various applications, including:
Matching Problems: Bipartite graphs are often used to model matching problems, where the goal is to find pairs of connected vertices with no common neighbors.

Network Flow: In network flow problems, bipartite graphs are used to model flow networks where resources flow from one set of nodes to another.

Social Networks: In social network analysis, bipartite graphs can represent relationships between two different types of entities, such as users and events.

Scheduling: Bipartite graphs can be used to model scheduling problems where tasks need to be assigned to workers or machines.

Coding Theory: In coding theory, bipartite graphs are used to model relationships between code words and error patterns.

One classic example of a bipartite graph is the marriage problem, where you have a group of men and women, 
and the edges represent potential marriages, with the goal of finding a set of non-overlapping marriages.
