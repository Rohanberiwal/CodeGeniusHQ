The concept of dual graphs is closely related to planar graphs.
The dual graph of a planar graph is obtained by associating a face of
the planar graph with each vertex of the dual graph. There are different 
algorithms to construct the dual graph of a planar graph. One common approach
involves the use of planar embeddings and the concept of faces.

Here's a high-level algorithm to construct the dual graph of a planar graph:

Input:

Start with a planar graph 

G with a planar embedding.
Create Faces:

Traverse the edges of the planar graph in a counterclockwise direction 
around each face. For each face, create a corresponding vertex in the dual graph.
Connect Adjacent Faces:

For every pair of adjacent faces in the planar graph, add an edge between their corresponding vertices in the dual graph.
Result:

The resulting graph is the dual graph of the original planar graph.
