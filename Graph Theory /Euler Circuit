In graph theory, an Eulerian circuit (or Eulerian cycle) is a circuit that
traverses every edge of a graph exactly once and returns to the starting node. 
If a graph has an Eulerian circuit, it is called an Eulerian graph. The concept is
named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who first studied and solved the
Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem, laying the foundation for graph theory.

Key properties of Eulerian circuits:

Even Degree Condition:

A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has an even degree 
(degree being the number of edges incident to a vertex). If a graph has exactly two vertices
with odd degrees, it has an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit.
Eulerian Circuit Algorithm:

Eulerian circuits can be found using algorithms that traverse edges in a way 
that covers all edges exactly once. The Hierholzer's algorithm is commonly used for this purpose. 
It constructs an Eulerian circuit by combining Eulerian paths in the graph.
Eulerian Graph Types:

There are different types of Eulerian graphs:
Semi-Eulerian Graph: A connected graph with exactly two vertices of odd degree.
It has an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit.
Eulerian Multigraph: A graph that may have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
Eulerian Digraph: A directed graph with an Eulerian circuit if and only if, for each vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree.
Applications:

Eulerian circuits and paths have applications in network design, transportation planning, 
and fault-tolerant systems. For example, in computer networks, the design of circuits that
traverse every link exactly once is crucial for efficient data transmission.
