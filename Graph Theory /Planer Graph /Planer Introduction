A planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane in such a way that no edges 
intersect except at their endpoints. In other words, it can be drawn on a flat surface (like a piece of paper) 
without any edges crossing each other.

Key Concepts:
Planar Embedding:

A planar embedding of a graph is a specific way of drawing the graph in the plane without any edge intersections.
Faces:

In a planar embedding, the plane is divided into regions called "faces."
There is an "outer face" (the unbounded region outside the graph), and the other faces are bounded by edges of the graph.
Euler's Formula:

For a connected planar graph with 

v−e+f=2.
Kuratowski's Theorem:

A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of 

  (complete graph on 5 vertices) or 

​
  (complete bipartite graph on sets of 3 vertices).
Graph Drawing:
Graphs that can be drawn without any edge intersections are called "planar graphs."

Planar graphs have applications in circuit design, network layout, and geographical mapping.
The concept of planarity is also important in graph theory and topology.
In summary, planar graphs have interesting properties and applications, and 
determining their planarity is a topic of study in graph theory.
