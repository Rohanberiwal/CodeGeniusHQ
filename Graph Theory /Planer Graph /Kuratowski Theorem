Kuratowski's Theorem: An Introduction

Kuratowski's theorem, named after the Polish mathematician Kazimierz Kuratowski, is a fundamental result in graph theory. The theorem characterizes planar graphs by identifying specific subgraphs that must not be present in a graph for it to be planar. In essence, the theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be planar.

Statement of Kuratowski's Theorem:

A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of either the complete graph 
  (a complete graph on five vertices) or the complete bipartite graph 
​
  (a complete bipartite graph on sets of three vertices).

Implications of Kuratowski's Theorem:

Planarity Characterization:

Kuratowski's theorem offers a way to check for planarity without having to search for a specific planar embedding.
Algorithmic Testing:

The theorem provides a basis for algorithmic approaches to test whether a graph is planar. Algorithms based on Kuratowski's theorem can efficiently determine the planarity of a graph by searching for forbidden subgraphs.
Algorithmic Approach for Planarity Testing:

One way to algorithmically test for planarity based on Kuratowski's theorem is through the following steps:

Search for 


Begin by searching for subgraphs that are subdivisions of 

​
  within the given graph.
Identification of Forbidden Subgraphs:
​
  is found as a subgraph, the graph is non-planar.
Planar Graph Otherwise:

If neither is found, the graph is planar.
