Euler's formula is a fundamental result in graph theory, and it 
relates the number of vertices, edges, and faces in a planar graph.
The formula is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, 
who first formulated it in the 18th century. Euler's formula for planar graphs can be stated as:

V−E+F=2

Here are the key postulates and concepts associated with Euler's formula:

Vertices (V):


V represents the number of vertices in the planar graph.
Edges (E):


E represents the number of edges in the planar graph.
Faces (F):


F represents the number of faces in the planar graph, including the unbounded outer face.
Euler's Formula:

The formula states that for any connected planar graph, the difference between the number of vertices (

V−E+F=2.
Planar Graph:

Euler's formula applies specifically to connected planar graphs, 
which are graphs that can be drawn in the plane without any edge intersections.
Euler Characteristic (
χ):

Euler's formula is often expressed in terms of the Euler characteristic (

χ=V−E+F.
For any connected planar graph, 

χ is equal to 2.
Polyhedron:

Euler's formula is also applicable to convex polyhedra (3D solids with flat faces). For a convex polyhedron, 

V−E+F=2.
Kuratowski's Theorem:

Euler's formula is closely related to Kuratowski's theorem, which characterizes planar graphs by excluding certain subgraphs.
