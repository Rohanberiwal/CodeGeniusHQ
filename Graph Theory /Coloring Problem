Graph coloring is a problem in graph theory that involves assigning colors to the vertices 
of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The objective 
is to use as few colors as possible while satisfying the coloring constraint.

Key Concepts:
Chromatic Number (χ):

The chromatic number of a graph, denoted as "x"
χ(G), is the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph 
such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
Vertex Coloring:

A vertex coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the vertices in such a 
way that no adjacent vertices share the same color.
Proper Coloring:

A proper coloring is a vertex coloring in which no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
Graph Coloring Algorithms:
Greedy Coloring:

The greedy coloring algorithm assigns colors to vertices one by one, choosing the smallest available
color at each step. It is a simple and commonly used algorithm, but it may not always produce an optimal solution.
Welsh-Powell Algorithm:

This algorithm sorts vertices by their degrees in descending order and then colors them in that order,
assigning the first available color to each vertex.
Sequential Coloring:

Sequential coloring algorithms explore the graph's structure to find an optimal coloring. Techniques 
include backtracking and constraint satisfaction.
Applications:
Map Coloring Problem:

Graph coloring has applications in cartography, where it is used to solve the map coloring problem.
The goal is to color regions of a map (represented as vertices) in such a way that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
Register Allocation in Compilers:

In compiler design, graph coloring is used for register allocation, where it helps determine which variables
should be stored in registers.
Frequency Assignment in Wireless Communication:

In wireless communication networks, graph coloring is applied to assign frequencies to transmitters to avoid interference.
Scheduling:

In scheduling problems, graph coloring can be used to assign time slots or resources to tasks while avoiding conflicts.
