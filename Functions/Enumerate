The enumerate function is a built-in function that is used to iterate through an iterable 
(e.g., a list, tuple, or string) while keeping track of the index (position) of the current item. 
It's particularly useful when you want to access both the index and the value of each element in an iterable within a loop

iterable is the collection you want to iterate through.
index is a variable that represents the current index (starting from 0 for the first element).
value is a variable that represents the current element in the iterable.
Here are some common use cases for enumerate:

Accessing Both Index and Value: As mentioned, the primary use of enumerate is to access both
the index and the value of each element in an iterable within a loop.

Example :
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")

Output :
Index 0: apple
Index 1: banana
Index 2: cherry
